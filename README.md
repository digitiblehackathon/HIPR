# HIPR - Human Initiated Performance Report

It is the first ever gamified “Internal Review” function; whereas the software validates the integrity of the chain data and secures the network through human initiation of smart contract checksums. 

# How does it work?

> HIPR takes in data sets, encrypts them into a tile slide puzzle game built on Web3 + Unity, and compares and contrasts the data sets prior to 3rd Party future analysis. 
> HIPR has direct connections to the Ethereum Blockchain for input data for [PlayerScore](https://github.com/hercone/contracts/playerscore.sol) functionality for payouts to the end user in HERC tokens. 
> The [puzzleManager.sol Smart Contract](https://github.com/HERCone/contracts/tree/master/assetVerification) creates a new puzzle based on the metrics imported, and then compares and contrasts the data sets from touchpointss along the same Supply Chain.
> The Audited files are sent to those involved in the Supply Chain Queries.
